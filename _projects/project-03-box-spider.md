This 12-axis quadruped robot features a compact, foldable design, allowing it to reduce its footprint when needed. It is equipped with both LiDAR and a 3D camera for enhanced perception and navigation. Chen played a key role in its development, designing the mechanism, assembling the hardware, and implementing a fundamental locomotion pattern to enable basic movement.
