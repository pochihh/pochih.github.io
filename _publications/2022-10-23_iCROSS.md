In this study, the infant Cardiac Robotic Surgical System (iCROSS) is developed to assist a surgeon in performing the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and other infant cardiac surgeries. The iCROSS is a dual-arm robot allowing two surgical instruments to collaborate in a narrow space while keeping a sufficiently large workspace. Compared with the existing surgical robotic systems, the iCROSS meets the specific requirements of infant cardiac surgeries. Its feasibility has been validated through several teleoperated tasks performed in the experiment. In particular, the iCROSS is able to perform surgical ligation successfully within one minute.
